# How to download a report/wallboard template and upload it to QueueMetrics:

You will find different download links below, for the individual reports/wallboards. You just need to follow the link and download the ".json" template files:

Once you have the template file, open your QueueMetrics instance.        

## Upload a Report to QueueMetrics
To upload a Report, simply click on a blank space, on the "Reports info box".

Now rename the report:     
![rename](https://github.com/Loway/Templates/assets/41002789/79c1e96b-4565-4881-afbf-97f869e6a9fd)        
        
And save the new blank report:          
![save2](https://github.com/Loway/Templates/assets/41002789/76b989da-eb11-4e62-b2b2-aba3bb65c33b)        
       
Now that you have at least one saved report, you will have the option to import templates from the upper left menu:          
![save3](https://github.com/Loway/Templates/assets/41002789/5f764cb3-8784-4483-8dde-cae201a363fd)      
      
And finally, upload the template:         
![upload](https://github.com/Loway/Templates/assets/41002789/4f73136e-f8cf-4733-b263-92571dfdd2b8)         

## Upload a Wallboard to QueueMetrics

Just like for the Reports, let's click on a blank space on the Wallboards info box:    
![blank](https://github.com/Loway/Templates/assets/41002789/8a5f22e3-5121-4302-9228-4fa841caf1d3)    
        
In the upper right corner of the Wallboard, you will find a menu and the "Import" button:     
![import](https://github.com/Loway/Templates/assets/41002789/a43d289d-8c7f-4363-be37-3ce20dc33bfb)      
    
Now you just have to choose the Wallboard template you want to upload and save the new Wallboard:        
![upload](https://github.com/Loway/Templates/assets/41002789/ed3dbd5c-d2a2-483c-8946-d4d6f210abf6)          
      
Now you will be able to further customize the Reports and Wallboards.
